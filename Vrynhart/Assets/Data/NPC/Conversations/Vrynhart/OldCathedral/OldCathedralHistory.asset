  Dialogue:
  - ~ Our Lady did not deserve such a fate. Still, it is said that time heals all
    wounds... It would seem however that our Lord will not let it try!
  - ~ Vrynhart's pain has turned to obsession! He's had his men out scouring the
    lands and capturing men to bring in for questioning regarding the murder.
  - ~ But with no results to show for his efforts our Lord is turning now to alternate
    solutions...
  - ~ <i>Demons are not to be called upon, their dark magic is not to be trusted!
    Yet this is our Lord's path!</i>
  - ~ I pray that Vrynhart's pleas are never answered... <i>I fear the consequences
    of dealings with the likes of demons...</i>
