  Dialogue:
  - ~ Lord Vrynhart has proved a powerful foe indeed. It would seem that I am far
    from the first hunter to have made a run at cleansing these lands.
  - ~ With any luck though I will be the last.
  - ~ I have searched this castle top to bottom and discovered many monstrosities,
    no doubt the manifestation of Vrynhart's curse--they will be dealt with in due
    time.
  - ~ But right now my focus is set. I must find Lord Vrynhart.
