  Dialogue:
  - So... another hunter arrives in Vrynhart, keen to rid these lands of it's beasts...
  - What a fool you are... just like me.
  - Lord Vrynhart did not fall to my metal, nor will he fall to yours...
  - If you're intent on pushing on I will have no choice but to kill you... I will
    not let yet another hunter join his ranks.
