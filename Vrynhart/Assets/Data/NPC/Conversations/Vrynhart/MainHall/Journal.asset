  Dialogue:
  - ~ Today I arrived at Castle Vrynhart, expecting to be met with a welcome party
    fit for a castle of its size, but instead found it dark and empty. I will stay
    and let my horses rest tonight. I will leave for home in the morning.
  - ~ It is dark as I write this now. I have just awoke in the night to horrible
    noises outside. The snow is too fierce for me to see out my window. <i>Perhaps
    that howling is but the wind?</i>
  - ~ This morning I had planned to leave for home but my carriage is nowhere to
    be found. I searched for hours today but came up empty handed. I will continue
    my search tomorrow.
  - ~ This is an odd place. I know it to be true that I am alone here yet I cannot
    shake this feeling that there are <i>eyes</i> everywhere.
  - ~ More strangeness today. I swear that I've seen objects move on their own. I
    think I've gone mad in this cold, cold place.
  - ~ <i>But what is that dreadful sound I hear in the night?</i>
