  Dialogue:
  - Ha! Greetings Hunter! Looking for a means into Vrynhart Castle are ye?
  - Well, I'll tell you what I told your Hunter friend, Draven.
  - There is another way into the Castle through the sewers.
  - Just take this path west and follow it over the river. The sewers are just past
    it.
  - Have fun! Ha!
