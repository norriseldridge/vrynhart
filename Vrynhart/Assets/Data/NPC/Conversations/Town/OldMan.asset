  Dialogue:
  - What's this? <i>Another hunter so soon?</i>
  - This is an unexpected surprise... But certainly a welcomed one. Your colleague
    only just arrived a few days ago.
  - Our town needs you! Horrible beasts lurk in the <color="#f00">Castle and woods</color>
    near by.
  - <i>Please-</i> Do what you can for our town. Should you need supplies, give a
    visit to <color="#ffd500">Margrave</color>.
